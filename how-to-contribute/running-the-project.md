# Running the Drupal Console

After running composer to download dependencies you can run the project executing

```
$ bin/console
```

### Create a symbolic link

You can run this command to easily access console from anywhere on your system:

```
$ sudo ln -s /path/to/DrupalAppConsole/bin/console /usr/local/bin/console
```

**NOTE:** The name `console` is just an alias you can name it anything you like to.


### Download box
The console project requires [Box](http://box-project.org/) project to create the console.phar. Box is an application that simplifies the Phar building process. Install in your system executing the following command.

```
curl -LSs https://box-project.github.io/box2/installer.php | php
```

You can run this command to easily access box from anywhere on your system:

```
$ mv box.phar /usr/local/bin/box
```

#### Create a custom Phar

To create a Phar file base in our dev version execute the following command

```
$ cd /path/to/DrupalAppConsole
$ box build
```

As result you will the a new file **console.phar**

**NOTE:** Make sure you set phar.readonly to '0' in your [php.ini](http://php.net/manual/en/phar.configuration.php)
