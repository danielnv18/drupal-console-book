```
$ composer update --no-dev
```

**NOTE:** Make sure run composer from the directory where the project was cloned.
```
$ cd /path/to/DrupalAppConsole
```

### Download Composer

Run this in your terminal to get the latest Composer version:
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```
Or if you don't have curl:
```
php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php

$ mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
